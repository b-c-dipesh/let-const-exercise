// What is the difference between var and let?
// - var is global and function scoped whereas let is block scoped.
// - variable hoisting is possible on var whereas let doesn't allow it.
// - we can redeclare variable declared with var whereas let doesn't allow it.
// - we can reassign value for a variable declared with var whereas let doesn't allow it.

// What is the difference between var and const?
